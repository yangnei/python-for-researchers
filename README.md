# Python for an Education Researcher — Course Package

A complete, ready-to-teach Python course adapted from **Harvard's CS50's Introduction to
Programming with Python (CS50P)**, re-sequenced and re-weighted for a **PhD-in-Education
student with no prior coding experience** but strong self-learning skills. The pace is
accelerated and the course is deliberately front-loaded with the **easily-missed language
fundamentals** (the dynamic-typing "traps") that beginners skip and later get bitten by.

- **Length:** 8–10 hours = **9 one-hour sessions** + an optional 10th capstone hour.
- **Two editions:** a clean **student** track and a **teacher** track (timing, transitions, misconceptions).
- **Everything original.** Topic *coverage* mirrors CS50P; all prose, slides, code, and cheat
  sheets here were written for this learner. CS50's own slides/notes are not reproduced.

> Built with three methods: **personalized-syllabus** (bridges to education-research background),
> **e-learning-course-creator** (the brief→curriculum→lessons→assessments pipeline), and the
> **DeepTutor** tutoring approach (Socratic prompts, predict-then-run, per-session quizzes,
> a running "misconceptions log"). *Note: the DeepTutor pedagogy is baked into the teacher notes;
> the actual self-hosted DeepTutor server is not provisioned here.*

## Two ready-to-use formats
- **Student → interactive website** (`docs/`): a GitHub Pages-ready site where the student runs
  **real Python in the browser** (via Pyodide — nothing to install), with editable code on every
  session page, collapsible solutions, self-checking quizzes, and progress tracking. See
  [Hosting on GitHub Pages](#hosting-the-student-site-on-github-pages).
- **Teacher → PDF** (`output/teacher-edition.pdf`): the full instructor playbook (minute-by-minute
  clocks, transition scripts, predicted misconceptions, Socratic prompts) + the outline, connection
  map, and quiz keys as appendices. Print it or read on screen.

## Start here
1. **Teacher:** open `output/teacher-edition.pdf` (or read `curriculum/syllabus-teacher.md`).
2. **Student:** open the website (`docs/index.html` locally, or the GitHub Pages URL once hosted).
3. Both: skim `curriculum/connection-map.md` — why each concept connects to research methods.
4. Keep the Cheat sheets page (or `cheatsheets/traps-and-gotchas.md`) open the entire course.

## Hosting the student site on GitHub Pages
1. Put this folder in a GitHub repo and push.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**: Source = *Deploy from a branch*,
   Branch = `main`, Folder = **`/docs`**. Save.
3. Your site goes live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` in a minute or two.
4. The first time a student clicks **Run**, the browser downloads the Python engine (~10 MB) once,
   then everything runs locally. Requires an internet connection (for the CDN libraries); after the
   first load it's cached. To preview locally: `cd docs && python3 -m http.server` then open
   `http://localhost:8000`.

## Regenerating the outputs
Both artifacts are generated from the markdown — edit the source, then rebuild:
```bash
# Student website  ->  docs/
python3 tools/build_site.py

# Teacher PDF  ->  output/teacher-edition.pdf   (needs the `markdown` package + chromium)
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install markdown
.venv/bin/python tools/build_teacher_pdf.py
```
The site needs no build dependencies (it renders markdown client-side); only the PDF build needs
`markdown` + a headless Chromium.

## The 9 sessions at a glance
| # | Title | CS50P source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Running Python, Variables & Types | W0 |
| 2 | **The Dynamic-Typing Traps** ⭐ (keystone) | W0/1/9 |
| 3 | Conditionals & Boolean Logic | W1 |
| 4 | Loops & Iteration | W2 |
| 5 | Data Structures (list/tuple/dict/set) | W2/6/9 |
| 6 | Functions, Scope & Reusability | W0/9 |
| 7 | Exceptions & Defensive Code | W3/5 |
| 8 | Files, Libraries & Research Data | W4/6 |
| 9 | Regex, Modules, OOP & "Pythonic" | W5/7/8/9 |
| 10 | Capstone (optional) | integrative |

## How to render the slides (optional)
The decks are plain Markdown with `---` slide breaks and Marp front-matter. To export to
HTML/PDF: `npx @marp-team/marp-cli slides/session-02-slides.md -o session-02.html`.
They also read fine as-is in any Markdown viewer.

## How to run the examples
Each `examples/session-XX/demo.py` is self-contained:
```bash
cd examples/session-02 && python3 traps_demo.py
cd examples/session-08 && python3 demo.py     # reads the bundled CSVs
```
Requires Python 3.11+. The only optional third-party packages are `pytest` (Session 7 test)
and `pandas` (Session 8 teaser); everything else is the standard library.

## Scaling to the available time
- **8 hours:** merge the lighter halves of S8/S9; drop the pandas teaser and regex depth.
- **9 hours:** run S1–S9 as written (recommended).
- **10 hours:** add the S10 capstone.
