# Learn Python — Course Package

A complete, ready-to-teach Python course for a **PhD-in-Education student with no prior coding
experience** but strong self-learning skills. The pace is accelerated and the course is
deliberately front-loaded with the **easily-missed language fundamentals** (the dynamic-typing
"traps") that beginners skip and later get bitten by.

- **Length:** **5 two-hour sessions** (~12 hours), each covering **two paired topics**, + an optional 6th capstone session.
- **Two editions:** a clean **student** track and a **teacher** track (timing, transitions, misconceptions).
- **Everything original.** All prose, slides, code, and cheat sheets here were written for this learner.

> Built with three methods: **personalized-syllabus** (bridges to education-research background),
> **e-learning-course-creator** (the brief→curriculum→lessons→assessments pipeline), and the
> **DeepTutor** tutoring approach (Socratic prompts, predict-then-run, per-session quizzes,
> a running "misconceptions log"). *Note: the DeepTutor pedagogy is baked into the teacher notes;
> the actual self-hosted DeepTutor server is not provisioned here.*

## Two ready-to-use formats
- **Student → interactive website** (`docs/`): a GitHub Pages-ready site where the student runs
  **real Python in the browser** (via Pyodide — nothing to install), with editable code on every
  session page, collapsible solutions, self-checking quizzes, and progress tracking. The site also
  offers a **downloadable student PDF** (`docs/learn-python-student.pdf`) for offline reading. See
  [Hosting on GitHub Pages](#hosting-the-student-site-on-github-pages).
- **Student → Jupyter notebooks** (`docs/notebooks/`): every session is also a self-contained
  `.ipynb`. Each session page links three ways to run it — **Run in browser** (a hosted
  [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) app in `docs/jupyter/`, no install),
  **Open in Colab**, and **Download .ipynb** for local Jupyter/VS Code.
- **Teacher → PDF** (`output/teacher-edition.pdf`): the full instructor playbook (minute-by-minute
  clocks, transition scripts, predicted misconceptions, Socratic prompts) + the outline, connection
  map, and quiz keys as appendices. Print it or read on screen.

## Start here
1. **Teacher:** open `output/teacher-edition.pdf` (or read `curriculum/syllabus-teacher.md`).
2. **Student:** open the website (`docs/index.html` locally, or the GitHub Pages URL once hosted).
3. Both: skim `curriculum/connection-map.md` — why each concept connects to research methods.
4. Keep the Cheat sheets page (or `cheatsheets/traps-and-gotchas.md`) open the entire course.

## Hosting the student site on GitHub Pages
1. Put this folder in a GitHub repo and push.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**: Source = *Deploy from a branch*,
   Branch = `main`, Folder = **`/docs`**. Save.
3. Your site goes live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` in a minute or two.
4. The first time a student clicks **Run**, the browser downloads the Python engine (~10 MB) once,
   then everything runs locally. Requires an internet connection (for the CDN libraries); after the
   first load it's cached. To preview locally: `cd docs && python3 -m http.server` then open
   `http://localhost:8000`.

## Regenerating the outputs
All artifacts are generated from the markdown — edit the source, then rebuild:
```bash
# Student website  ->  docs/
python3 tools/build_site.py

# Jupyter notebooks  ->  docs/notebooks/*.ipynb   (from examples/, no extra deps)
python3 tools/build_notebooks.py

# In-browser JupyterLite app  ->  docs/jupyter/   (one-time tooling, then rebuild)
python3 -m venv .venv-jlite
.venv-jlite/bin/pip install jupyterlite-core jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel jupyter-server
bash tools/build_jupyterlite.sh

# Teacher PDF  ->  output/teacher-edition.pdf       (needs the `markdown` package + chromium)
# Student PDF  ->  docs/learn-python-student.pdf
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install markdown
.venv/bin/python tools/build_teacher_pdf.py
.venv/bin/python tools/build_student_pdf.py
```
The site and notebooks need no special dependencies (the site renders markdown client-side; the
notebook generator is plain Python). The PDF builds need `markdown` + a headless Chromium, and the
JupyterLite app needs the `jupyterlite-*` tooling shown above. Regenerate notebooks **before**
rebuilding JupyterLite so the in-browser copies stay in sync.

## The 5 sessions at a glance (two paired topics each)
| # | Title | Part A · Part B |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Running Python, Types & the Type Traps | Variables & types · the dynamic-typing traps |
| 2 | Control Flow & Data Structures | conditionals & loops · list/tuple/dict/set |
| 3 | Functions, Scope & Recursion | functions & scope · recursion |
| 4 | Exceptions, Files & Research Data | exceptions & validation · files, CSV & libraries |
| 5 | Regular Expressions, Modules & OOP | regex & text cleaning · modules, OOP & the Pythonic toolkit |
| 6 | Capstone (optional) | Gradebook & Survey Analyzer, end to end |

## How to render the slides (optional)
The decks are plain Markdown with `---` slide breaks and Marp front-matter. To export to
HTML/PDF: `npx @marp-team/marp-cli slides/session-01-slides.md -o session-01.html`.
They also read fine as-is in any Markdown viewer.

## How to run the examples
Each `examples/session-XX/demo.py` is self-contained (two halves, Part A + Part B):
```bash
cd examples/session-01 && python3 demo.py     # types + the traps
cd examples/session-04 && python3 demo.py     # reads the bundled CSVs (Part B)
```
Requires Python 3.11+. The only optional third-party packages are `pytest` (Session 4 test)
and `pandas` (Session 4 teaser); everything else is the standard library.

## Scaling to the available time
- **~10 hours:** drop the Pythonic-toolkit tour in S5 Part B and the pandas/json teaser in S4;
  keep both halves' core of every session.
- **~12 hours:** run S1–S5 as written, two hours each (recommended).
- **~14 hours:** add the S6 capstone.

## Note
All instructional content in this package — prose, slides, code, cheat sheets, and quizzes —
is original.
