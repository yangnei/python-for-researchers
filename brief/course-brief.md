# Course Brief — Python for an Education Researcher

## Topic
Introduction to Programming with Python, adapted from Harvard's **CS50's Introduction
to Programming with Python (CS50P)**, re-sequenced for a fast-moving adult learner and
deliberately weighted toward the **easily-missed language fundamentals** (type/identity/
equality semantics, truthiness, mutability, scope) that beginners skip and later get bitten by.

## Target Learner (single student)
- **Who:** A PhD candidate in **Education**.
- **Coding background:** None. Has never written a line of code in any language.
- **Learning profile:** Strong, disciplined self-learner; comfortable with abstraction,
  research methods, and reading dense material. Can absorb concepts faster than the median
  CS50 student, so the pace is **accelerated** and the hand-holding is reduced.
- **Domain knowledge to leverage:** research design, descriptive & inferential statistics,
  survey/Likert data, qualitative coding of open responses, spreadsheets, citation/data
  management. Examples in this course are deliberately drawn from these areas.

## Prerequisites
- A computer with Python 3.11+ installed (or access to VS Code / an online editor).
- Willingness to type every example, not just read it.
- No math beyond what an education-stats course already requires.

## Desired Outcomes (what the student can DO afterward)
By the end the student can:
1. Read and write Python programs using variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and files.
2. **Explain and avoid** the classic dynamic-typing traps: `==` vs `is`, `int`/`float`/`bool`
   interactions, float precision, mutable defaults, aliasing, and scope errors.
3. Load, clean, summarize, and write out **tabular research data** (CSV) in Python.
4. Validate messy human input defensively with exceptions and regular expressions.
5. Organize code into functions, modules, and a small class; write a basic test.
6. Build one small, education-relevant capstone (e.g., a gradebook/survey analyzer).

## Format & Duration
- **8–10 hours total**, delivered as **9 one-hour sessions** (+ an optional 10th capstone hour).
- Each session is self-contained: Concept → Live Example → Practice → Traps recap → Summary.
- Two parallel tracks of materials:
  - **Student edition** — clean syllabus, slides, runnable examples, cheat sheets.
  - **Teacher edition** — everything above *plus* timing hints, transition scripts,
    Socratic prompts, predicted misconceptions, and "what to cut if you're behind."

## Non-Goals (explicit scope cuts)
- Not a data-science course: pandas/NumPy/matplotlib get a single guided *teaser*, not depth.
- No web frameworks, async, packaging, or deployment.
- No exhaustive standard-library tour; we cover what a researcher actually reaches for.
- Statistics *concepts* are assumed known — we only show how to compute them in Python.

## Source & Attribution
Topic coverage mirrors CS50P (Weeks 0–9: Functions/Variables, Conditionals, Loops,
Exceptions, Libraries, Unit Tests, File I/O, Regular Expressions, OOP, Et Cetera). All
lesson prose, slides, examples, and cheat sheets here are **original**, written for this
learner; CS50's own lecture slides and notes are not reproduced.
